Welcome to **`freeCodeCampLisbon`**'s Landing Page project!

# Description

For all the new persons who don't know: [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) is an open source community that helps you learn to code and get a job as a developer. You also build pro bono project for non-profits.

This community has a lot of communities around the world! freeCodeCampLison one of more than 1,000 camp sites that already exist.

We have a [weekly meeting](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.lisbon/) at [Edge Portugal](http://www.edge.pt) where we code, help and educate each other.

There we decided to create our first community project: our Landing Page!

This will not be developed by the group admins or people who already have a lot of knowledge in this area. It will be developed by students, by people who are learning to code! Like this, we will learn the workflow to build such a project in a team and how to use the appropriate tools.
