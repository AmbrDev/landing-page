Welcome to **`freeCodeCampLisbon`** Landing page project!

# Description

For all the new persons comes to see for the first time, freeCodeCamp is an open source community that helps you learn to code, build pro bono project for nonprofits, and get a job as a developer.

This community had a lot of communities around the world! And we're one of more that 1,000 campsites that already exists.

And that's why we decide to create our first project: our lading page community!

This will not be develop from group admin or people have already knowledge on this area, it will be develop from students, from people who are
learning to code.
